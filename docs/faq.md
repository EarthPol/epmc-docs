   - [How Towny Works](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/How-Towny-Works) 

# Basic Siegewar Commands

Siegewars usually last 3 days, to allow players from different time zones to contribute.
   - **Add another nation as an ally**: `/n ally add (nation name)`
   - **Add another nation as an enemy**: `/n enemy add (nation name)`
   - **Talk privately with your nation’s allies**: `/ac` (use `/g` to return to general chat)
   - **Start a siege**: Place a single color banner (not white) right outside a town
   - **Gain points within a siege**: To gain banner control, stand in proximity to the banner for 10 minutes, after which you will start earning points. Killing enemies is another way to gain points.
   - **Winning a siege**: The side that has the most points when the siege timer ends wins. If the attacker wins, they may plunder the defeated town by placing a chest near the edge of the town. This transfers gold from the losing town to the victorious side. The winning attackers can also capture the defeated town by adding a second single colored banner outside the town. This will forcibly add the town to the victorious nation for a few days.

Note: During the siege, `/t spawn` to other towns within your nation is disabled (you only can `/t spawn` to your own town)

If you do not want to participate in siege wars, you can toggle your town or nation’s peaceful status: `/t toggle peaceful` or `/n toggle peaceful`


# Keep Inventory

There is no keep inventory. You drop everything when you die :skull_and_crossbones:. 

If you die :skull_and_crossbones:, you will lose your items at that location and be teleported back to your town spawn, unless you have a `/home` set inside your town.
If you don’t have a town, you’ll be teleported to the world spawn. There is no `/back`.


# Teleporting

**[Premium Members]( https://store.earthpol.com/category/336784)** members can use `/tpahere` to request another player to teleport to them anywhere in their own town or alliance claims.

   - `/t spawn (name of town)` to visit towns that are part of their nation.
   - `/n spawn (name of nation)` to visit nations that are close (within ‘sphere of influence’) and allied with them.

There is no random teleport (`/rtp` and `/wild` disabled) or warps.
